## source
At position $\vec{r}_s$ there is source of vibration

$$\tag{1}
\psi_s(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \sin(\omega_i t + \varphi_i)
$$

which is simplified as superposition of $N$ simple harmonic motion of physical quantity $A_i$ with angular frequency $\omega_i$ and initial phase $\varphi_i$, where $A_i$ migth represent difference between variation of air pressure and normal atmospheric pressure

$$\tag{2}
\Delta p = p(t) - p_0
$$

or difference between variation of position of parts of solid body, e.g. the ground, to their equilibrium position

$$\tag{3}
\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}(t) - \vec{r}_0.
$$  

Sound waves are accomodated by Eqn (2), while waves on solid are by Eqn (3). The first are longitudinal waves, while the later could be longitudinal and transversal waves.
